## Sliding Window

## Objectives

* Introduction of sliding window problems
* Relationship to recursion
* Sliding window recongntion
* Sliding window tools
* Problems and solutions

## Sliding Window Problems

### Recognition

- Are we working with a linear dataset?
  - string
  - array
  - linked list

- Are wer tring to minimize some smaller subset within that linear data set?

- Does O quadratic solution come to mind immediately?
  - Do you see overlapping work occur during the quadratic runtime solution

### Tools

- Go for a quadratic approach first
  - What data structures or state variables are used?

- Transition to a two-pointer apprach with left and right pointers beginning at index 0
  - How can we make use of the quadratic runtime data structure(s)?
  - Hunting Phase logic
  - Catchup Phase logic
