# Binary Numbers

As humans, we typically represent numvers in the decimal system. Couting to ten is as simple as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Computers represent all information in bits. In order to represent numbers with just 0s and 1s, computers us the binary number system. Here's what it looks like when a computer counts to ten: 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010.

## Binary Numbers


The binary system works the same way as decimal. The only difference is that instead of multiplying the digit by a power of 10, we multiply it by a power of 2.

Let's look at the decimal number 1, represented in binary as 0001:

0    0    0    1
8    4    2    1
2^3 2^2  2^1  2^0 

That's the same as (0*8) + (0*4) + (0*2) + (1*1), or 0 + 0 + 0 + 1.

Okay, perhaps you could have guessed that one -- now for a bigger number.
