Rob - "The ZettelKasten Method is attributed to Niklas Luhmann who was a very prolific thinker and writer. The concept is rather intuitive to someone with nothing more than paper and pen and wooden boxes. It's just a file system that gets out of your way and lets you think creatively, and then later organizing those thoughts. Ironically, modern technology has diluted and nearly destroyed the cognitive value of the original approach. Therefore, my approach maintains the strict compatibility with the exact same system on paper. Indeed, I use a notepad with sheets divided in half with a drawn line to create many of my Zettels before ever (if ever) adding them to the digital version. Everything I can do digitally I can always do on paper."
