## This information isn't very relevant to me. The VM doesn't run on Mac. So I am just saving wasteful notes while I work on the VM problem.

* What is NAT and Bridged?

In regards to virtual machines. Nat would be similar to having the computer in it's own private network. Until you reach out. Bridged will allow the VM to work like any other computer on your network. It will get a real ip from the rounter.

* What is an IP Address?

On a very high level. This will be how your computer knows which packets are for that computer. The router will give out IP addresses to maintain identity. There is also IP addresses for internet access points.

* What is `git-bash` and why would I need it?

This is something that's for a windows machine. Macs shouldn't use `git-bash`

* What about `putty` for ssh access? 
* Where are all my files and why are they there?
* How do I remove add and rename files and directories?
* How do I edit files?

* `ip a` - show all IP addresses 
* `clear` - clear console screen
* `which ssh` - display full path to ssh program
* `type ssh` - is it a command
