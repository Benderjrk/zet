# Origins Of Algebra

The word along with the idea comes from Al-Kwarizmi a persian mathmatician. Around 820 AD and Algebra means restoration and completion.

2000 BC            1000 BC               +                 1000 AD                2000 AD

The first traces around algebra came from Ancient Babylon. 2000 BC.

Diophantus is sometimes credited of being the father of algebra slightly after 50 AD 

Around 600 AD Brahmagupta made significant contributions.


## Abstract

* idea
* art
* noun
* many different things

The essence of a real world object.

The idea of the real world object in a concept. Not painting reality as it exists, but how we can comprehend it.

"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language .. without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." - Galileo Galilei


Reunion of broken parts.

"I think therefor I am."

"You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that
could be make. But I just kept pushing."

Rene Descartes 1596-1650

## Algebra y = 2x - 1

  x   |     y
-2      2(-2)-1 = -5
-1      2(-1)-1 = -3
 0      2(0)-1 = -1
 1      2(1)-1 = 1
 2      2(2)-1 = 3
