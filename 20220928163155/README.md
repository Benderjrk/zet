# If you are a failure and you resent others success

This is not something that you should do. Learning to enjoy your work is
the way to reach success. 

There was a man named the lord of the hobos. He was a very avid writer.
He learned to dramatize his life. Found ways to enjoy it. The secret of
success is to talk yourself interesting to others. Find a way to make
your life interesting to yourself.

* If you don't have a smile. Don't open a shop.

* What good has my honesty done me? It won't do anything without a smile.

* Talking too much about your affairs and scattering will put you against
a high wall.

* Silence is golden.

* Success is not a secret. It is a system. 

Most people give up before something big comes to them. So don't give
up.

* Don't get angry, get busy.

* Refuse to be discouraged


You believe what the person says and you make a new agreement. You may
believe you are ugly. Even if you are not.
