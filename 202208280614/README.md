# Some days it is harder to start than others

## Taking notes can be hard

I find that putting thought down is challenging.

* People judge without thinking
* People are angry and stupid all the time.
* People are scared into listening

## When to workout

* Before the sun gets up
* Before the other people get up
* Now

Moving does more than help the body grow. It helps maintain equilibrium of your bones. If you don't workout and just slouch all day. There is a good change your back will hurt. It'll start all the way from for hips. They just won't be able to support themselves.

## Workout everyday

* Walk
* Run
* Bike
* Swim
* Push
* Pull
* Have fun

## Eat healthy

## Notes Apology

I'm going to struggle with these notes for a little and they may even seen off. I don't know how to keep and order to something like this. I cannot just stop because I don't know. I must try and learn from my experiences. Maybe others can also learn along the way.
