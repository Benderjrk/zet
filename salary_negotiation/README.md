# Outco Salary Negotiation

Today we figure out how to talk salary negotiations today. It's
something I have needed to do.

## How do you negotiate?

* when you get an offer
* how do you negotiate
* show that you appreciate the offer
* don't share too much
* sincere but neutral
* do not be over excited
* have a paper trail and documentations
* have the offer letter if possible. Or get an email
* take notes on the call
* validate the call and offer letter
* if needed - defer till later
* get what you need and get off the phone
* negotiations over email is easier
* send an email to the recruiter and confirm all the things
* contract other recruiters about offer

## Why email negotiation?

Recruiters negotiate all the time - email is an equalizer

The negotiation is when you get the offer letter.
